Droog
=====

Droog is a short, traditional roguelike, with brutal combat and limited
resources, set in a post-apocalyptic, zombified, ruined city.

Here's what we mean by this:
- A **short** game can be _won_ in under ten hours. Many will be shorter than
that!
- A **traditional roguelike** features permanent death, randomly-generated maps,
and turn-based action.
- **Brutal combat** means death is easy, healing is hard and hit points aren't
everything. In fact, in Droog, they don't exist.
- With **limited resources**, every item counts and every item is useful. There
aren't many of them, but finding one will feel great.
- A **post-apocalyptic, zombified, ruined city** is what it says on the tin.
Danger lurks behind every corner.
