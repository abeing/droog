Enemies
=======

**Zombies** are zombified humans and start with average stregth, dexterity and
constitution before recieving a bonus to one score or with some lowish chance
(which increases over time) an item. *They can bite poorly*. Their bites have a
low chance of causing plague.

**Zombie dogs** are zombified dogs and start with high dexterity, average
strength and low constitution. They can bite well but cannot use items. They
will also move faster. Bites have a higher chance of causing plague.

**Cops** are robotic patrol officers. They have hardy armor and start with a
weapon. Other names I've considered: RoboCop, Ropal (Robotic Pal)
